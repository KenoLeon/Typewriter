# Typewriter

Duplicates the functionality of a typewriter. Every keystroke is committed to the page. Deleting text will only strike it out with a line.

See the [live demo here](http://davidmerfield.github.io/typewriter/).

Yes this is silly.

### Build the desktop app

Make sure node.js is up to date. Make sure you have node's package manager. Navigate to project's root directory, install the node modules specified in ./package.json using 
npm install' and then run 'grunt'. 

Grunt will build and package the app then place it in ./builds
