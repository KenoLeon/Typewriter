# Typewriter App

The app basically removes lots of useful functionality
from a pair of contenteditable divs. Specifically:

- No text can be deleted from the divs.
- Selected text is struck out when the user presses delete
- Only text the user types is added to the divs. 
- Text can only be added to the end of the divs. 

The app basically works by mirroring the content of one div in another.
Doing this allows us to hide the system's native caret and draw our own.

# Implementation ideas

if you stop typing, perhaps increase the pulse of the caret?

by default strikethroughs are removed from saved version

Rich text makes most sense so strikethroughs can be included

If you save at rtf then you preserve strikethroughs

Be able to move selection caret with keys (would look like text selection). Pressing another character except delete would continue typing as normal. 

Will need an RTF to HTML parser, html to RTF parser. Can I encode this shit as a text file?

Does the txt format allow for hidden text? Or some markup?

**The goal would be to be able to open the text file in another program and not see the strikethroughs.**

Would be awesome to include strikethroughs in our program, but same text file doesn't show them when opened in another.

select all text,
copy selected text

## Thoughts

There's a caret but you can't move it with the arrow keys. Somehow change the cursor to something which communicates deletion. You can select text, perhaps even move a pseudo caret for selection purposes with the keyboard. But you cannot change the location for the next input of text.

Always onwards, always forwards.

one press of the key, one character
(you can't hold down key and produce lines of characters)
