I actually think people would use this. 

this is not a tool for editing
this is not a tool for formatting
this is not a tool for people who care about word counts
this is a tool for extracting your thoughts and slamming them onto the page, 

If hemingway made software, he would use this.

No sounds. No options. No toggles.

Should be free as in air.

There's a caret but you can't move it with the arrow keys. Somehow change the cursor to something which communicates deletion. You can select text, perhaps even move a pseudo caret for selection purposes with the keyboard. But you cannot change the location for the next input of text.

Always onwards, always forwards.

one press of the key, one character
(you can't hold down key and produce lines of characters)
