I actually think people would use this. 

this is not a tool for editing
this is not a tool for formatting
this is not a tool for people who care about word counts
this is a tool for extracting your thoughts and slamming them onto the page, 

No sounds. No options. No toggles.

Should be free as in air.

There's a caret but you can't move it with the arrow keys. Somehow change the cursor to something which communicates deletion. You can select text, perhaps even move a pseudo caret for selection purposes with the keyboard. But you cannot change the location for the next input of text.

Always onwards, always forwards.

one press of the key, one character
(you can't hold down key and produce lines of characters)

# homepage

homepage of a beam of light falling on white window (matches os) with text being typed and text particles flying.

# Pick a typeface

Droid sans mono? yes
Source code pro
inconsolata maybe

# Implementation

if you stop typing, perhaps increase the pulse of the caret?

by default strikethroughs are removed from saved version

Rich text makes most sense so strikethroughs can be included

If you save at rtf then you preserve strikethroughs

Be able to move selection caret with keys (would look like text selection). Pressing another character except delete would continue typing as normal. 

Will need an RTF to HTML parser, html to RTF parser. Can I encode this shit as a text file?

Does the txt format allow for hidden text? Or some markup?

**The goal would be to be able to open the text file in another program and not see the strikethroughs.**

Would be awesome to include strikethroughs in our program, but same text file doesn't show them when opened in another.

select all text,
copy selected text
